Overview
NeuralFusion™ is a cognitive skill framework designed to train the human mind to integrate multiple thinking modes into a single controlled synthesis process.
Rather than optimizing individual thinking styles (analytical, intuitive, associative, reflective), NeuralFusion™ focuses on coordinating them under conscious command.
This repository serves as the canonical technical and theoretical reference for the NeuralFusion™ framework.

Core Idea
Human cognition fails not because of lack of intelligence, but because thinking modes operate in fragmentation.
NeuralFusion™ introduces:
• Mental mode awareness
• Mode regulation
• Synthesis anchoring
• Temporal compression of cognition

Result:
Stable clarity under complexity.
Core Components
Cognitive Anchor
Temporal Compression
